Ran port scan on IP.  Here are the open ports:

PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp 
22/tcp   open  ssh
53/tcp   open  domain
2121/tcp open  ccproxy-ftp



Steps taken:

* Used provided credentials to log into ccproxy-ftp.
* With ftp access, I downloaded the ssh pub and private keys and the bash history
* Bash history showed that the user had created a flag file and moved into a flag directory in /home/
* Used ssh keys to log into server and get flag file.
* Note: I did need to modify the permissions of the ssh files
